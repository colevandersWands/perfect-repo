----------------------

This is a demo of a finished project.
Finshed projects aren't working code, they're coherent github repos.  
  
A coherent repo will have: 
  * a descriptive readme  
  * tags for all intermediary steps
  * helpful commit messages
  * branches when necessecary
  * a gh-pages demo of the final step
  * specs for the final step
  * a few tests to show you tried
  * a todo list: no project is every truely finished
